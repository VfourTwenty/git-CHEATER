# Commit Distributor

**Generate generic or custom commits to your repositories! Look productive, don't be stressed :)**

Wonder how others manage to make tens of commits daily and have a bright green chart on github?
Well, it's all hard work and discipline! Or not always so?.. 
Git itself offers a feature of interactive rebasing, and this project takes advantage of the system's possibilities to allow for commit addition, deletion and distribution in seconds with Python and Bash automation!

## Features
- Add generic commits to a private repository.
- Make as many commits as you like and randomly distribute them over a range.
- Safe and quick commit deletion from local repositories.

## Upcoming Features
- View your productivity graph like on GitHub, but for an individual repo.
- Interactively select dates and time ranges to include and exclude from making commits.
- Alter commit frequency and density.

Stay tuned for updates!
Smart commit message generation and more coming soon!
